### Part 1

Instructions: Implement Policy Gradients for a neural network doing something.

* Task: OpenAI Gym CartPole-v0
* Algorithm: Episodic One-step Actor-Critic implementation based on [S&B] page 332

To run with default arguments: `$ python AC.py`

### Part 2

Instructions: Implement Genetic Algorithm for a neural network doing something.

* Task: OpenAI Gym CartPole-v0
* Algorithm: Evolution Strategies implementation based on [Sal17]

### Part 3: Do a bit of research (something new)
